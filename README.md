# Getting Started with Canonical Assessment

This is a simple SPA with React for viewing blog posts in cards.

The deployed application can be viewed [here](https://canonical-assessment.netlify.app/).

## First Step

Clone the repo:

### `git clone https://github.com/Dampolo03/canonical-assessment.git`

## Second Step

In the project directory, run the following commands:

### 2.1

To install all dependencies:

### `npm i`

### 2.2

To run the app in the development mode:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser after compilation.

### 2.3

To build the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance:

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run build`

### 2.4

To purge or remove unused CSS - reducing unnecessary bytes consumed by network activity.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run postbuild`
